here '_', '-', '&' is not considered in url 

Steps:
	>user will make a request wid the original url...
		>>system will get the url and store it in db and will generate a primary key this primary key will be id_hash unique key which
		  can be generated by system with some defined rules.
		
		>>now when the unique seed is generated then use this seed to get base62 url shortner value 
		  return this shortner by appending to url
		
		>>now when the short url willbe used to get the original one, we will bifurcate the unique short value
		  get it back to base10 and generate the unique id_hash and fetch from db using this primary value.
		
		
	>db table:
			id_hash (base 62 generated string as primary key)
			original_url
			shorten_url
			creation_date
			expiration_date

>for scalability:

	>>cache will be used acc to requirement like centralized redis server can be used memcache can also be used
		
		
>the code in class file is just to create short url identifier from unique seed and reverse
